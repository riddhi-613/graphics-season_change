# 🌦️ Season Simulation - Computer Graphics Project

This project simulates seasonal changes through a visually rich environment using **OpenGL**, demonstrating dynamic weather conditions, vegetation transitions, and environmental animations.


## 📌 Project Description

This OpenGL-based simulation animates a countryside scene with different seasonal elements. It includes dynamic changes such as:

- Seasonal transitions (Summer, Rainy, Spring, Autumn, Winter)
- Environmental effects (rain, clouds, vegetation)
- Interactive boat movement and cloud control


## 🎮 Controls

| Key       | Function                    |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| `1-9`, `0`| Direct season selection     |
| `N`       | Next season                 |
| `P`       | Previous season             |
| `R`       | Toggle rain                 |
| `S`       | Stop rain                   |
| `←/→`     | Control boat speed          |
| `Mouse`   | Move clouds                 |
